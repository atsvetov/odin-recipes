        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tom yum soup is easy to make at home with this recipe. Koong or goong is the Thai word for shrimp, 
            which is featured in this tom yum koong recipe. Many ingredients can be found in your local Thai, Asian, or 
            specialty shop. Chile paste with soybean oil comes in small jars and can be found in most Asian markets. Galangal, 
            a member of the ginger family, is a knobby root that tastes like a cross between ginger and pepper. Makrut lime 
            leaves have an aromatic citrus-like smell and flavor. Garnish this shrimp tom yum soup with fresh cilantro leaves.
